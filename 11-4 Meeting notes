	1. Plotting locations on a map
		maptools, OpenStreetMaps
		
	2. First/Last Mile
		How is the current system already used for First-Mile last Mile commuting?
		Which bike stops are transit stations - find T stops that have Hubway nearby
		Percentage of users doing this
		
	3. Time Saved - else
		Expected walking distance
		Pick most common blue bike routes  to compare and their neighborhoods
		Compare to car time if took Uber - try with Google Maps API 
		Time vary - commuting vs weekend times
		Neighborhoods
			Voronoi maps over Google maps to understand how far people will
				Over Google maps https://www.showmeshiny.com/google-maps-voronoi/
				Algorithm https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/00wi/projects/voronoi.html
		Seasonal Differences 
		How far do people expect to walk to nearest hubway - which neighborhoods are underserved?
			observations : are stations with smaller expected walk time more popular?
		
		Steps: 
			pick routes of interest
			build voronoi diagram for areas of interest 
			find avg  time to bike (avg walk + bike + walk)
			find avg car commute time (Google maps API) + Uber wait time
			Compare time saved (diff between) w/ uncertainty measures (Entropy or variance)
			
		
	4. Networks - Jinghong, Miranda 
		Build network of nodes as hubway 
		measure flow between stations - some weight for passing by, vs 
		clustering in geographical areas - areas that are more connected
		compare to a model of the network 
		
		Transit stops? 
		Visualizations
	
	5. Action Items
		Time Saved - understand API inputs, outputs, endpoints
		Networks - https://networkx.github.io/
			save location information as attributes
			save file of graph
			think up subquestions to ask and graph analysis 
			cluster based on usage or neighborhood characteristics
